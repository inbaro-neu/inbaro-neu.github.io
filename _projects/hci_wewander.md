## Overview

<div class="row d-flex align-items-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    <p>The WeWander project aimed to solve the problem of connecting solo travelers based on shared interests, offering an alternative to expensive, rigid tour groups. The design process involved creating a user-friendly interface, drawing inspiration from online dating apps for user task flow and matchmaking. Key features included account verification, profile building, a travel questionnaire, and a companion selection tool. The project underwent iterations based on user feedback and heuristic evaluations, leading to improvements in usability, navigation, and error prevention. Future evaluations would focus on recruiting representative participants and addressing remaining usability issues, like verification steps and profile editing options.</p>
