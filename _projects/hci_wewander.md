## Overview

<div class="row d-flex align-items-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    <p>The WeWander project aimed to solve the problem of connecting solo travelers based on shared interests, offering an alternative to expensive, rigid tour groups. The target user base comprises primarily young adults seeking travel companions. The application's workflow mirrors that of an online dating app, involving account verification, profile building, a travel questionnaire, and a section for selecting travel companions.</p>
    <p>Initial designs, inspired by dating apps, revealed certain usability issues during paper prototyping and heuristic evaluations. Key insights included the need for clearer navigation, error prevention mechanisms, and distinct separation of application components to avoid confusion. The revised design focused on enhancing usability with features like back buttons, a cleaner interface, and clearly defined sections.</p>
    <p>The implementation involves a multi-step process: users start on a homepage, verify their account, build a profile highlighting travel experiences, and answer a questionnaire about travel plans and preferences. The core feature is a matchmaking algorithm that suggests compatible travel companions. Additional features include an "Explore" section for discovering travel destinations.</p>
    <p>However, the current prototype has limitations, like static user profiles and limited interactivity. Future evaluations will involve representative participants, focusing on refining usability and functionality, particularly in destination and language entry, profile editing, and user experience continuity.</p>
