- This project is still in progress and is estimated to be completed by December 15, 2023.

## Background

This project addresses the spillover effect of the Israel-Palrstine conflict on anti-religious hate crimes. The conflict's escalation, especially the massacre of October 7, 2023, has led to a rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia globally. Understanding this correlation is critical in predicting and preventing hate crimes in the US.

## Objective

The goal is to create predictive models that correlate conflict flare-ups with rates of hate crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities in the US. By leveraging time series data, this project aims to forecast periods of increased hate crime risk, facilitating proactive measures against such crimes.

## Data Sources

- FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program: Provides detailed hate crime statistics.
- Humanitarian Data Exchange: Offers comprehensive datasets on Israel-Palestine conflict casualties.

## Methodology

The methodology includes:
- Using time series forecasting models like ARIMA and LSTM neural networks.
- Training models on historical data spanning two decades.
- Evaluating modelsâ€™ ability to predict hate crime spikes based on conflict data.
