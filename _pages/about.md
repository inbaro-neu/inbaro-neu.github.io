I am an honors student at Northeastern University studying computer science and behavioral neuroscience, with an expected graduation date of December 2023. I've completed co-ops in both computer science and healthcare, as well as participated in computational and wet lab biology research. In my free time, I like to write and design for NU Sci, the Northeastern science magazine, and take aerial hammock classes.

I am currently seeking a part-time position (~25-30 hrs/week) in software engineering, data science, computational biochemistry, or UI/UX design, with potential to expand to full-time in January 2024.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `profile_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
